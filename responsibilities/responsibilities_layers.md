### Feature: Scheduling preferences for teachers

As a teacher, I want to edit/add preferences before the schedule is finalized by the scheduling committee, so that I can specify _when_ and _what_ classes I want to teach.

#### Feature breakdown

1. The teacher accesses their dashboard to set or edit scheduling preferences.
2. The system allows teachers to select their available time slots (depending on the school schedule, e.g., 8:00 - 9:30).
3. The system allows teachers to choose specific courses they want to teach.
4. The system saves teacher preferences for later access by the scheduling committee and shows them visualization.
5. The system provides conflict resolution suggestions (if multiple teachers prefer the same time slots or the schedule doesn't work for students).
6. The final schedule generation will take teacher preferences into account whenever possible.

#### Responsibilities

##### Selecting available time slots interface (P)

- Teachers can view and select available time slots in a user-friendly format (e.g., calendar or dropdown).

##### Selecting specific course interface (P)

- Teachers can choose from a list of courses they are qualified to teach.

##### Schedule visualization (P)

- Display a calendar that shows the teacher's current preferences and conflicts

##### Resolution interface (P)

- If there are conflicts, offer an interface that highlights suggestions for editing schedule

##### Validate timeslots (B)

- Ensure the teacher's chosen time slots are valid and do not overlap their existing already scheduled class, if exists

##### Validate course selection (B)

- Check that the teacher is qualified and authorized to teach the selected courses

##### Conflict resolution (B)

- Identify conflicts in time slots or course assignments (e.g., two teachers wanting the same time or course)
  and provide conflict resolution options (e.g., alternative times)

##### Preferences schedule generation (B)

- Generate a tentative schedule using teacher preferences, taking into account conflicts and school policies (like room availability)

##### Enforce deadlines (B)

- Prevent teachers from editing preferences after a certain deadline.

##### Store preferences (I)

- Store teacher time slot preferences and selected courses in a persistent database. Ensure data is versioned for auditing.

##### Retrieve stored preferences (I)

- Allow teachers or scheduling committee (based on authorization) to access saved preferences at any time before finalization.

##### Log changes (I)

- Keep a log of all changes to preferences, including timestamps and the user making the change.
- Keep a log of all proposed conflicts.

##### Store final schedule (I)

- Save the outcome of conflict resolutions, whether automated or manually handled by teachers or committee members.
