# Feature: Validating schedules

As the scheduling committee, I want to be able to manually validate any schedule so that I may be notified if the schedule breaks any rules (e.g., room overlaps, time conflicts, instructor availability).

#### Feature breakdown

1. The scheduling committee (SC) receives or creates a schedule.
2. A member of SC logs into the management dashboard and navigates to the schedule validation section.
3. A specific schedule is selected for validation.
4. The SC member initiates the validation process.
5. The system checks the schedule for conflicts or violations.
6. If any issues are found (e.g., room double-booking or time conflicts), the SC member is notified with details on the violation.

#### Responsibilities

##### Schedule collection

- Ensure schedules are stored in a centralized database.
- Schedules should be accessible and easily viewable through a user-friendly interface.

##### Validation

- Implement a rule engine for checking schedule conflicts (e.g., overlapping rooms, instructor availability).
- Validate schedule constraints based on defined rules (e.g., time slots, resource allocation).
- Generate a detailed validation report.

##### Error notification

- Detect and display rule violations during the validation process.
- Notify the SC member of any issues via the dashboard and email notifications.
- Provide actionable error messages for easy resolution of conflicts.

##### Reporting and logging

- Generate a detailed report of validation results, highlighting conflicts and suggested resolutions.
- Log validation activities and results for recovery purposes.
- Allow SC members to download or export validation reports.
